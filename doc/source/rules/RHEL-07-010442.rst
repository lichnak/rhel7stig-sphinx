RHEL-07-010442 - The operating system must not allow a non-certificate trusted host SSH logon to the system.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Severity
~~~~~~~~

Medium

Description
~~~~~~~~~~~

Failure to restrict system access to authenticated users negatively impacts operating system security.

Check
~~~~~

Verify the operating system does not allow a non-certificate trusted host SSH logon to the system.

Check for the value of the HostbasedAuthentication keyword with the following command:

# grep -i hostbasedauthentication /etc/ssh/sshd_config
HostbasedAuthentication no

If the “HostbasedAuthentication” keyword is not set to “no”, is missing, or is commented out, this is a finding.
