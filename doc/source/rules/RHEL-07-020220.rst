RHEL-07-020220 - The x86 Ctrl-Alt-Delete key sequence must be disabled.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

Severity
~~~~~~~~

High

Description
~~~~~~~~~~~

A locally logged-on user who presses Ctrl-Alt-Delete, when at the console, can reboot the system. If accidentally pressed, as could happen in the case of a mixed OS environment, this can create the risk of short-term loss of availability of systems due to unintentional reboot. In the GNOME graphical environment, risk of unintentional reboot from the Ctrl-Alt-Delete sequence is reduced because the user will be prompted before any action is taken.

Check
~~~~~

Verify the operating system is not configured to reboot the system when Ctrl-Alt-Delete is pressed.

Check that the ctrl-alt-del.service is not active with the following command:

# systemctl status ctrl-alt-del.service
reboot.target - Reboot
   Loaded: loaded (/usr/lib/systemd/system/reboot.target; disabled)
   Active: inactive (dead)
     Docs: man:systemd.special(7)

If the ctrl-alt-del.service is active , this is a finding.
