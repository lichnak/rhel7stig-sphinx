--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Severity
~~~~~~~~

Medium

Description
~~~~~~~~~~~

If a public host key file is modified by an unauthorized user, the SSH service may be compromised.

Check
~~~~~

Verify the SSH public host key files have mode “0644” or less permissive.

Note: SSH public key files may be found in other directories on the system depending on the installation.

The following command will find all SSH public key files on the system:

# find / -name '*.pub'

Check the mode of the public host key files under /etc/ssh file with the following command:

# ls -lL /etc/ssh/*.pub
-rw-r--r--  1 root  wheel  618 Nov 28 06:43 ssh_host_dsa_key.pub
-rw-r--r--  1 root  wheel  347 Nov 28 06:43 ssh_host_key.pub
-rw-r--r--  1 root  wheel  238 Nov 28 06:43 ssh_host_rsa_key.pub

If any file has a mode more permissive than “0644”, this is a finding.
