RHEL-07-040410 - The system must ignore to Internet Protocol version 4 (IPv4) Internet Control Message Protocol (ICMP) redirect messages.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Severity
~~~~~~~~

Medium

Description
~~~~~~~~~~~

ICMP redirect messages are used by routers to inform hosts that a more direct route exists for a particular destination. These messages modify the host's route table and are unauthenticated. An illicit ICMP redirect message could result in a man-in-the-middle attack.

Check
~~~~~

Verify the system ignores IPv4 ICMP redirect messages.

Check the value of the “accept_redirects” variables with the following command:

# /sbin/sysctl -a | grep  'net.ipv4.conf.*.accept_redirects'
net.ipv4.conf.default.accept_redirects=0
net.ipv4.conf.all.accept_redirects=0

If both of the returned line do not have a value of “0”, a line is not returned, or the retuned line is commented out, this is a finding.
