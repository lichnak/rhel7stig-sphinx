--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Severity
~~~~~~~~

Medium

Description
~~~~~~~~~~~

If an unauthorized or modified device is allowed to exist on the system, there is the possibility the system may perform unintended or unauthorized operations.

Check
~~~~~

Verify that all system device files are correctly labeled to prevent unauthorized modification.

List all device files on the system that are incorrectly labeled with the following commands:

Note: Device files are normally found under “/dev”, but applications may place device files in other directories, necessitating a search of the entire system.

#find /dev -context *:device_t:* \( -type c -o -type b \) -printf "%p %Z\n"

#find /dev -context *:unlabeled_t:* \( -type c -o -type b \) -printf "%p %Z\n"

If there is output from either of these commands, this is a finding.
