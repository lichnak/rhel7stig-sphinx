RHEL-07-040320 - For systems using DNS resolution, at least two name servers must be configured.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Severity
~~~~~~~~

Low

Description
~~~~~~~~~~~

To provide availability for name resolution services, multiple redundant name servers are mandated. A failure in name resolution could lead to the failure of security functions requiring name resolution, which may include time synchronization, centralized authentication, and remote system logging.

Check
~~~~~

Determine whether the system is using local or DNS name resolution with the following command:

# grep hosts /etc/nsswitch.conf
hosts:   files dns

If the dns entry is missing from the host’s line in the “/etc/nsswitch.conf” file, the “/etc/resolv.conf” file must be empty.

Verify the “/etc/resolv.conf” file is empty with the following command:

# l s -al /etc/resolv.conf
-rw-r--r--  1 root root        0 Aug 19 08:31 resolv.conf

If local host authentication is being used and the “/etc/resolv.conf” file is not empty, this is a finding.

If the dns entry is found on the host’s line of the “/etc/nsswitch.conf” file, verify the operating system is configured to use two or more name servers for DNS resolution.

Determine the name servers used by the system with the following command:

# grep nameserver /etc/resolv.conf
nameserver 192.168.1.2
nameserver 192.168.1.3

If less than two lines are returned that are not commented out, this is a finding.
