RHEL-07-010372 - Accounts subject to three unsuccessful login attempts within 15 minutes must be locked for the maximum configurable period.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Severity
~~~~~~~~

Medium

Description
~~~~~~~~~~~

By limiting the number of failed logon attempts, the risk of unauthorized system access via user password guessing, otherwise known as brute-forcing, is reduced. Limits are imposed by locking the account.

Satisfies: SRG-OS-000329-GPOS-00128, SRG-OS-000021-GPOS-00005

Check
~~~~~

Verify the operating system automatically locks an account for the maximum period for which the system can be configured.

Check that the system locks an account for the maximum period after three unsuccessful logon attempts within a period of 15 minutes with the following command:

# grep pam_faillock.so /etc/pam.d/password-auth
auth        required       pam_faillock.so preauth silent audit deny=3 even_deny_root unlock_time=604800
auth        [default=die]  pam_faillock.so authfail audit deny=3 even_deny_root unlock_time=604800

If the “unlock_time” setting is greater than 604800 on both lines with the pam_faillock.so module name or is missing from a line, this is a finding.
