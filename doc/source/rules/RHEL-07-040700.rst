RHEL-07-040700 - The SSH daemon must not allow compression or must only allow compression after successful authentication.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Severity
~~~~~~~~

Medium

Description
~~~~~~~~~~~

If compression is allowed in an SSH connection prior to authentication, vulnerabilities in the compression software could result in compromise of the system from an unauthenticated connection, potentially with root privileges.

Check
~~~~~

Verify the SSH daemon performs compression after a user successfully authenticates.

Check that the SSH daemon performs compression after a user successfully authenticates with the following command:

# grep -i compression /etc/ssh/sshd_config
Compression delayed

If the “Compression” keyword is set to “yes”, is missing, or the retuned line is commented out, this is a finding.
