RHEL-07-040620 - The SSH daemon must be configured to only use Message Authentication Codes (MACs) employing FIPS 140-2 approved cryptographic hash algorithms.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Severity
~~~~~~~~

Medium

Description
~~~~~~~~~~~

DoD information systems are required to use FIPS 140-2 approved cryptographic hash functions. The only SSHv2 hash algorithm meeting this requirement is SHA.

Check
~~~~~

Verify the SSH daemon is configured to only use MACs employing FIPS 140-2 approved ciphers.

Note: If RHEL-07-021280 is a finding, this is automatically a finding as the system cannot implement FIPS 140-2 approved cryptographic algorithms and hashes.

Check that the SSH daemon is configured to only use MACs employing FIPS 140-2 approved ciphers with the following command:

# grep -i macs /etc/ssh/sshd_config
MACs hmac-sha2-256,hmac-sha2-512

If any ciphers other than “hmac-sha2-256” or “hmac-sha2-512” are listed or the retuned line is commented out, this is a finding.
