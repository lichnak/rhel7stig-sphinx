RHEL-07-010371 - If three unsuccessful logon attempts within 15 minutes occur the associated account must be locked.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Severity
~~~~~~~~

Medium

Description
~~~~~~~~~~~

By limiting the number of failed logon attempts, the risk of unauthorized system access via user password guessing, otherwise known as brute-forcing, is reduced. Limits are imposed by locking the account.

Satisfies: SRG-OS-000329-GPOS-00128, SRG-OS-000021-GPOS-00005

Check
~~~~~

Verify the operating system automatically locks an account until the locked account is released by an administrator when three unsuccessful logon attempts in 15 minutes are made.

Check that the system locks the account after three unsuccessful logon attempts within a period of 15 minutes with the following command:

# grep pam_faillock.so /etc/pam.d/password-auth
auth        required       pam_faillock.so preauth silent audit deny=3 even_deny_root fail_interval=900
auth        [default=die]  pam_faillock.so authfail audit deny=3 even_deny_root fail_interval=900

If the “fail_interval” setting is greater than 900 on both lines with the pam_faillock.so module name or is missing from a line, this is a finding.
