RHEL-07-030340 - The audit system must take appropriate action when the audit storage volume is full.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Severity
~~~~~~~~

Medium

Description
~~~~~~~~~~~

Taking appropriate action in case of a filled audit storage volume will minimize the possibility of losing audit records.

Check
~~~~~

Verify the action the operating system takes if the disk the audit records are written to becomes full.

To determine the action that takes place if the disk is full on the remote server, use the following command:

# grep -i disk_full_action /etc/audisp/audisp-remote.conf
disk_full_action = single

To determine the action that takes place if the network connection fails, use the following command:

# grep -i network_failure_action /etc/audisp/audisp-remote.conf
network_failure_action = stop

If the value of the “network_failure_action” option is not “syslog”, “single”, or “halt”, or the line is commented out, this is a finding.

If the value of the “disk_full_action” option is not "syslog", "single", or "halt", or the line is commented out, this is a finding.
