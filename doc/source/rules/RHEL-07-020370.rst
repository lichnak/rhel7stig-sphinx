RHEL-07-020370 - All files and directories must have a valid group owner.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

Severity
~~~~~~~~

Medium

Description
~~~~~~~~~~~

Files without a valid group owner may be unintentionally inherited if a group is assigned the same Group Identifier (GID) as the GID of the files without a valid group owner.

Check
~~~~~

Verify all files and directories on the system have a valid group.

Check the owner of all files and directories with the following command:

# find / -fstype local -xdev -nogroup

If any files on the system do not have an assigned group, this is a finding.
