RHEL-07-030331 - The operating system must encrypt the transfer of audit records off-loaded onto a different system or media from the system being audited.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Severity
~~~~~~~~

Medium

Description
~~~~~~~~~~~

Information stored in one location is vulnerable to accidental or incidental deletion or alteration.

Off-loading is a common process in information systems with limited audit storage capacity.

Satisfies: SRG-OS-000342-GPOS-00133, SRG-OS-000479-GPOS-00224

Check
~~~~~

Verify the operating system encrypts audit records off-loaded onto a different system or media from the system being audited.

To determine if the transfer is encrypted, use the following command:

# grep -i enable_krb5 /etc/audisp/audisp-remote.conf
enable_krb5 = yes

If the value of the “enable_krb5” option is not set to "yes" or the line is commented out, this is a finding.
