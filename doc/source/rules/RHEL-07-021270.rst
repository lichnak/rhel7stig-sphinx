RHEL-07-021270 - The system must use a separate file system for /tmp (or equivalent).
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Severity
~~~~~~~~

Low

Description
~~~~~~~~~~~

The use of separate file systems for different paths can protect the system from failures resulting from a file system becoming full or failing.

Check
~~~~~

Verify that a separate file system/partition has been created for /tmp.

Check that a file system/partition has been created for “/tmp” with the following command:

# grep /tmp /etc/fstab
UUID=7835718b    /tmp    ext4    nodev,nosetuid,noexec      1 2

If a separate entry for /tmp is not in use, this is a finding.
