RHEL-07-010260 - The system must not have accounts configured with blank or null passwords.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Severity
~~~~~~~~

High

Description
~~~~~~~~~~~

If an account has an empty password, anyone could log on and run commands with the privileges of that account. Accounts with empty passwords should never be used in operational environments.

Check
~~~~~

To verify that null passwords cannot be used, run the following command: 

# grep nullok /etc/pam.d/system-auth

If this produces any output, it may be possible to log on with accounts with empty passwords.

If null passwords can be used, this is a finding.
