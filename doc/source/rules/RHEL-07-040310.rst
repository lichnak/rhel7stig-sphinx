RHEL-07-040310 - The system must not permit direct logons to the root account using remote access via SSH.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Severity
~~~~~~~~

Medium

Description
~~~~~~~~~~~

Even though the communications channel may be encrypted, an additional layer of security is gained by extending the policy of not logging on directly as root. In addition, logging on with a user-specific account provides individual accountability of actions performed on the system.

Check
~~~~~

Verify remote access using SSH prevents users from logging on directly as root.

Check that SSH prevents users from logging on directly as root with the following command:

# grep -i permitrootlogin /etc/ssh/sshd_config
PermitRootLogin no

If the “PermitRootLogin” keyword is set to “yes”, is missing, or is commented out, this is a finding.
