RHEL-07-010220 - Passwords for new users must be restricted to a 60-day maximum lifetime.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Severity
~~~~~~~~

Medium

Description
~~~~~~~~~~~

Any password, no matter how complex, can eventually be cracked. Therefore, passwords need to be changed periodically. If the operating system does not limit the lifetime of passwords and force users to change their passwords, there is the risk that the operating system passwords could be compromised.

Check
~~~~~

Verify the operating system enforces a 60-day maximum password lifetime restriction for new user accounts.

Check for the value of “PASS_MAX_DAYS” in /etc/login.defs with the following command:

# grep -i pass_max_days /etc/login.defs
PASS_MAX_DAYS     60

If the “PASS_MAX_DAYS” parameter value is not 60 or less, or is commented out, this is a finding.
