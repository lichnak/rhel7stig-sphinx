RHEL-07-020300 - All Group Identifiers (GIDs) referenced in the /etc/passwd file must be defined in the /etc/group file.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Severity
~~~~~~~~

Low

Description
~~~~~~~~~~~

If a user is assigned the GID of a group not existing on the system, and a group with the GID is subsequently created, the user may have unintended rights to any files associated with the group.

Check
~~~~~

Verify all GIDs referenced in the “/etc/passwd” file are defined in the “/etc/group” file.

Check that all referenced GIDs exist with the following command:

# pwck -r

If GIDs referenced in “/etc/passwd” file are returned as not defined in “/etc/group” file, this is a finding.
