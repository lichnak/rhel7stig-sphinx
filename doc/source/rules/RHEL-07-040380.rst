RHEL-07-040380 - The system must not respond to Internet Protocol version 4 (IPv4) Internet Control Message Protocol (ICMP) echoes sent to a broadcast address.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Severity
~~~~~~~~

Medium

Description
~~~~~~~~~~~

Responding to broadcast (ICMP) echoes facilitates network mapping and provides a vector for amplification attacks.

Check
~~~~~

Verify the system does not respond to IPv4 ICMP echoes sent to a broadcast address.

Check the value of the icmp_echo_ignore_broadcasts variable with the following command:

# /sbin/sysctl -a | grep  net.ipv4.icmp_echo_ignore_broadcasts
net.ipv4.icmp_echo_ignore_broadcasts=1

If the returned line does not have a value of “1”, a line is not returned, or the retuned line is commented out, this is a finding.
