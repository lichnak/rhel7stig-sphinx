RHEL-07-020230 - The operating system must define default permissions for all authenticated users in such a way that the user can only read and modify their own files.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Severity
~~~~~~~~

Medium

Description
~~~~~~~~~~~

Setting the most restrictive default permissions ensures that when new accounts are created, they do not have unnecessary access.

Check
~~~~~

Verify the operating system defines default permissions for all authenticated users in such a way that the user can only read and modify their own files.

Check for the value of the “UMASK” parameter in “/etc/login.defs” file with the following command:

Note: If the value of the “UMASK” parameter is set to “000” in “/etc/login.defs” file, the Severity is raised to a CAT I.

# grep -i umask /etc/login.defs
UMASK  077

If the value for the “UMASK” parameter is not “077”, or the “UMASK” parameter is missing or is commented out, this is a finding.
