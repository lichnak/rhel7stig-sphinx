RHEL-07-010070 - The operating system must initiate a screensaver after a 15-minute period of inactivity for graphical user interfaces.

Severity

Medium

Description
~~~~~~~~~~~

A session time-out lock is a temporary action taken when a user stops work and moves away from the immediate physical vicinity of the information system but does not log out because of the temporary nature of the absence. Rather than relying on the user to manually lock their operating system session prior to vacating the vicinity, operating systems need to be able to identify when a user's session has idled and take action to initiate the session lock.

The session lock is implemented at the point where session activity can be determined and/or controlled.

Check
~~~~~

Verify the operating system initiates a screensaver after a 15-minute period of inactivity for graphical user interfaces. The screen program must be installed to lock sessions on the console.

Note: If the system does not have GNOME installed, this requirement is Not Applicable.

Check to see if GNOME is configured to display a screensaver after a 15 minute delay with the following command:

# grep -i idle-delay /etc/dconf/db/local.d/*
idle-delay=uint32 900

If the "idle-delay" setting is missing or is not set to “900” or less, this is a finding.
