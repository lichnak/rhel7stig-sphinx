RHEL-07-040070 - The cn_map file must be owned by root.
-------------------------------------------------------

Severity
~~~~~~~~

Medium

Description
~~~~~~~~~~~

Without mapping the certificate used to authenticate to the user account, the ability to determine the identity of the individual user or group will not be available for forensic analysis.

Check
~~~~~

Verify the operating system protects the file that maps the authenticated identity to the user or group account for PKI–based authentication.

Check the owner on the cn_map file with the following command:

# ls –al /etc/pam_pkcs11/cn_map
–rw––––––– 1 root root 1294 Apr 22 17:22 /etc/pam_pkcs11/cn_map

If the cn_map file has an owner other than root, this is a finding.
