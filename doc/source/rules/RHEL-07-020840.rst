RHEL-07-020840 - All local initialization files for interactive users must be owned by the home directory user or root.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Severity
~~~~~~~~

Medium

Description
~~~~~~~~~~~

Local initialization files are used to configure the user's shell environment upon logon. Malicious modification of these files could compromise accounts upon logon.

Check
~~~~~

Verify all local initialization files for interactive users are owned by the home directory user or root.

Check the owner on all local initialization files with the following command:

Note: The example will be for the “smithj” user, who has a home directory of “/home/smithj”.

# ls -al /home/smithj/.* | more
-rwxr-xr-x  1 smithj users        896 Mar 10  2011 .bash_profile
-rwxr-xr-x  1 smithj users        497 Jan  6  2007 .login
-rwxr-xr-x  1 smithj users        886 Jan  6  2007 .profile

If any file that sets a local interactive user’s environment variables to override the system is not owned by the home directory owner or root, this is a finding.
