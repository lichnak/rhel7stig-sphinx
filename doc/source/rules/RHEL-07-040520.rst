RHEL-07-040520 - If the Trivial File Transfer Protocol (TFTP) server is required, the TFTP daemon must be configured to operate in secure mode.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Severity
~~~~~~~~

Medium

Description
~~~~~~~~~~~

Restricting TFTP to a specific directory prevents remote users from copying, transferring, or overwriting system files.

Check
~~~~~

Verify the TFTP daemon is configured to operate in secure mode.

Check to see if a TFTP server has been installed with the following commands:

# yum list installed | grep tftp
tftp-0.49-9.el7.x86_64.rpm

If a TFTP server is not installed, this is Not Applicable.

If a TFTP server is installed, check for the server arguments with the following command: 

# grep server_arge /etc/xinetd.d/tftp
server_args = -s /var/lib/tftpboot

If the “server_args” line does not have a -s option and the directory /var/lib/tftpboot, this is a finding.
