RHEL-07-030490 - The operating system must generate audit records for all successful/unsuccessful account access count events.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Severity
~~~~~~~~

Medium

Description
~~~~~~~~~~~

Without generating audit records that are specific to the security and mission needs of the organization, it would be difficult to establish, correlate, and investigate the events relating to an incident or identify those responsible for one.

Audit records can be generated from various components within the information system (e.g., module or policy filter).

Satisfies: SRG-OS-000392-GPOS-00172, SRG-OS-000470-GPOS-00214, SRG-OS-000473-GPOS-00218

Check
~~~~~

Verify the operating system generates audit records when successful/unsuccessful account access count events occur. 

Check the file system rule in /etc/audit/rules.d/audit.rules with the following commands: 

# grep -i /var/log/tallylog etc/audit/audit.rules

-w /var/log/tallylog -p wa -k logins

If the command does not return any output, this is a finding.
