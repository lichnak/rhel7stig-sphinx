RHEL-07-040301 - The system must display the date and time of the last successful account logon upon an SSH logon.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Severity
~~~~~~~~

Medium

Description
~~~~~~~~~~~

Providing users with feedback on when account accesses via SSH last occurred facilitates user recognition and reporting of unauthorized account use.

Check
~~~~~

Verify SSH provides users with feedback on when account accesses last occurred.

Check that “PrintLastLog” keyword in the sshd daemon configuration file is used and set to “yes” with the following command:

# grep -i printlastlog /etc/ssh/sshd_config
PrintLastLog yes

If the “PrintLastLog” keyword is set to “no”, is missing, or is commented out, this is a finding.
