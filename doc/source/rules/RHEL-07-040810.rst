RHEL-07-040810 - The system must use a local firewall.
------------------------------------------------------

Severity
~~~~~~~~

Medium

Description
~~~~~~~~~~~

A firewall provides the ability to enhance system security posture by restricting services to known good IP addresses and address ranges. This prevents connections from unknown hosts and protocols.

Check
~~~~~

Verify that a firewall is in use on the system.

Check to see if “firewalld” is installed with the following command:

# yum list installed | grep firewalld

If “firewalld” is not installed, ask the System Administrator if they are performing another method of access control (such as iptables) for all network services on the system. 

If there is no access control being performed on all network services, this is a finding.

If “firewalld” is installed, determine whether it is active with the following command:

# systemctl status firewalld
firewalld.service - firewalld - dynamic firewall daemon
   Loaded: loaded (/usr/lib/systemd/system/firewalld.service; enabled)
   Active: active (running) since Sun 2014-04-20 14:06:46 BST; 30s ago

If “firewalld” is not active, this is a finding.
