RHEL-07-040421 - The system must not send Internet Protocol version 4 (IPv4) Internet Control Message Protocol (ICMP) redirects.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Severity
~~~~~~~~

Medium

Description
~~~~~~~~~~~

ICMP redirect messages are used by routers to inform hosts that a more direct route exists for a particular destination. These messages contain information from the system's route table, possibly revealing portions of the network topology.

Check
~~~~~

Verify the system does not send IPv4 ICMP redirect messages.

Check the value of the "all send_redirects" variables with the following command:

# /sbin/sysctl -a | grep  net.ipv4.conf.all.send_redirects

net.ipv4.conf.all.send_redirects=0

If the returned line does not have a value of “0”, a line is not returned, or the retuned line is commented out, this is a finding.
