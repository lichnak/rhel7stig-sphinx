RHEL-07-040740 - The Network File System (NFS) must be configured to use AUTH_GSS.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Severity
~~~~~~~~

Medium

Description
~~~~~~~~~~~

When an NFS server is configured to use AUTH_SYS, a selected userid and groupid are used to handle requests from the remote user. The userid and groupid could mistakenly or maliciously be set incorrectly. The AUTH_GSS method of authentication uses certificates on the server and client systems to more securely authenticate the remote mount request.

Check
~~~~~

Verify “AUTH_GSS’ is being used to authenticate NFS mounts.

To check if the system is importing an NFS file system, look for any entries in the “/etc/fstab” file that have a file system type of “nfs” with the following command:

# cat /etc/fstab | grep nfs
192.168.21.5:/mnt/export /data1 nfs4 rw,sync ,soft,sec=sys, krb5:krb5i:krb5p

If the system is mounting file systems via NFS and has the sec option without the “krb5:krb5i:krb5p” settings, the sec option has the “sys” setting, or the “sec” option is missing, this is a finding.
