RHEL-07-010460 - Systems with a Basic Input/Output System (BIOS) must require authentication upon booting into single-user and maintenance modes.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Severity
~~~~~~~~

High

Description
~~~~~~~~~~~

If the system does not require valid root authentication before it boots into single-user or maintenance mode, anyone who invokes single-user or maintenance mode is granted privileged access to all files on the system. GRUB 2 is the default boot loader for RHEL 7 and is designed to require a password to boot into single-user mode or make modifications to the boot menu.

Check
~~~~~

Check to see if an encrypted root password is set. On systems that use a BIOS, use the following command:

# grep -i password /boot/grub2/grub.cfg
password_pbkdf2 superusers-account password-hash

If the root password entry does not begin with “password_pbkdf2”, this is a finding.
