RHEL-07-040860 - The system must not forward IPv6 source-routed packets.
------------------------------------------------------------------------

Severity
~~~~~~~~

Medium

Description
~~~~~~~~~~~

Source-routed packets allow the source of the packet to suggest that routers forward the packet along a different path than configured on the router, which can be used to bypass network security measures. This requirement applies only to the forwarding of source-routed traffic, such as when IPv6 forwarding is enabled and the system is functioning as a router.

Check
~~~~~

Verify the system does not accept IPv6 source-routed packets.

Note: If IPv6 is not enabled, the key will not exist, and this is not a finding.

Check the value of the accept source route variable with the following command:

# /sbin/sysctl -a | grep  net.ipv6.conf.all.accept_source_route
net.ipv6.conf.all.accept_source_route=0

If the returned lines do not have a value of “0”, a line is not returned, or the retuned line is commented out, this is a finding.
