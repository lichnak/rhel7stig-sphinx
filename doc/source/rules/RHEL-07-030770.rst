RHEL-07-030770 - The system must send rsyslog output to a log aggregation server.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Severity
~~~~~~~~

Medium

Description
~~~~~~~~~~~

Sending rsyslog output to another system ensures that the logs cannot be removed or modified in the event that the system is compromised or has a hardware failure.

Check
~~~~~

Verify “rsyslog” is configured to send all messages to a log aggregation server.

Check the configuration of “rsyslog” with the following command:

# grep @ /etc/rsyslog.conf
*.* @@logagg.site.mil

If there are no lines in the “/etc/rsyslog.conf” file that contain the “@” or “@@” symbol(s), and the lines with the correct symbol(s) to send output to another system do not cover all “rsyslog” output, this is a finding.
