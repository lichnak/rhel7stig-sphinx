RHEL-07-010373 - If three unsuccessful root logon attempts within 15 minutes occur the associated account must be locked.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Severity
~~~~~~~~

Medium

Description
~~~~~~~~~~~

By limiting the number of failed logon attempts, the risk of unauthorized system access via user password guessing, otherwise known as brute-forcing, is reduced. Limits are imposed by locking the account.

Satisfies: SRG-OS-000329-GPOS-00128, SRG-OS-000021-GPOS-00005

Check
~~~~~

Verify the operating system automatically locks the root account until it is released by an administrator when three unsuccessful logon attempts in 15 minutes are made.

# grep pam_faillock.so /etc/pam.d/password-auth
auth        required       pam_faillock.so preauth silent audit deny=3 even_deny_root fail_interval=900
auth        [default=die]  pam_faillock.so authfail audit deny=3 even_deny_root fail_interval=900

If the “even_deny_root” setting is not defined on both lines with the pam_faillock.so module name, this is a finding.
