RHEL-07-040590 - The SSH daemon must be configured to only use the SSHv2 protocol.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Severity
~~~~~~~~

High

Description
~~~~~~~~~~~

SSHv1 is an insecure implementation of the SSH protocol and has many well-known vulnerability exploits. Exploits of the SSH daemon could provide immediate root access to the system.

Satisfies: SRG-OS-000074-GPOS-00042, SRG-OS-000480-GPOS-00227

Check
~~~~~

Verify the SSH daemon is configured to only use the SSHv2 protocol.

Check that the SSH daemon is configured to only use the SSHv2 protocol with the following command:

# grep -i protocol /etc/ssh/sshd_config
Protocol 2
#Protocol 1,2

If any protocol line other than "Protocol 2" is uncommented, this is a finding.
