RHEL-07-020680 - All files and directories contained in local interactive user home directories must be owned by the owner of the home directory.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Severity
~~~~~~~~

Medium

Description
~~~~~~~~~~~

If local interactive users do not own the files in their directories, unauthorized users may be able to access them. Additionally, if files are not owned by the user, this could be an indication of system compromise.

Check
~~~~~

Verify all files and directories in a local interactive user’s home directory are owned by the user.

Check the owner of all files and directories in a local interactive user’s home directory with the following command:

# ls -lLR /<home directory path>/<users home directory>/
/home/smithj
-rw-r--r-- 1 smithj smithj  18 Mar  5 17:06 file1
-rw-r--r-- 1 smithj smithj 193 Mar  5 17:06 file2
-rw-r--r-- 1 smithj smithj 231 Mar  5 17:06 file3

If any files are found with an owner different than the home directory user, this is a finding.
