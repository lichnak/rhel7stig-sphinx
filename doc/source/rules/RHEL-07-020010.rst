RHEL-07-020010 - The ypserv package must not be installed.
----------------------------------------------------------

Severity
~~~~~~~~

High

Description
~~~~~~~~~~~

Removing the "ypserv" package decreases the risk of the accidental (or intentional) activation of NIS or NIS+ services.

Check
~~~~~

The NIS service provides an unencrypted authentication service that does not provide for the confidentiality and integrity of user passwords or the remote session.

Check to see if the “ypserve” package is installed with the following command:

# yum list installed | grep ypserv

If the “ypserv” package is installed, this is a finding.
