RHEL-07-030630 - All uses of the pam_timestamp_check command must be audited.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Severity
~~~~~~~~

Medium

Description
~~~~~~~~~~~

Without generating audit records that are specific to the security and mission needs of the organization, it would be difficult to establish, correlate, and investigate the events relating to an incident or identify those responsible for one.

Check
~~~~~

Verify the operating system generates audit records when successful/unsuccessful attempts to use the pam_timestamp_check command occur. 

Check the auditing rules in /etc/audit/rules.d/audit.rules with the following command:

# grep -i /sbin/pam_timestamp_check /etc/audit/rules.d/audit.rules

-a always,exit -F path=/sbin/pam_timestamp_check -F perm=x -F auid>=1000 -F auid!=4294967295  -F subj=unconfined_u:unconfined_r:unconfined_t:s0-s0:c0.c1023 -k privileged-pam  

If the command does not return any output, this is a finding.
