RHEL-07-040300 - The system must display the date and time of the last successful account logon upon logon.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Severity
~~~~~~~~

Low

Description
~~~~~~~~~~~

Providing users with feedback on when account accesses last occurred facilitates user recognition and reporting of unauthorized account use.

Check
~~~~~

Verify that users are provided with feedback on when account accesses last occurred.

Check that “pam_lastlog” is used and not silent with the following command:

# grep pam_lastlog /etc/pam.d/postlogin

session     required      pam_lastlog.so showfailed silent

If “pam_lastlog” is missing from “/etc/pam.d/postlogin” file, or the silent option is present on the line check for the “PrintLastLog” keyword in the sshd daemon configuration file, this is a finding.
