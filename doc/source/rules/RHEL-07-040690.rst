RHEL-07-040690 - The SSH daemon must use privilege separation.
--------------------------------------------------------------

Severity
~~~~~~~~

Medium

Description
~~~~~~~~~~~

SSH daemon privilege separation causes the SSH process to drop root privileges when not needed, which would decrease the impact of software vulnerabilities in the unprivileged section.

Check
~~~~~

Verify the SSH daemon performs privilege separation.

Check that the SSH daemon performs privilege separation with the following command:

# grep -i usepriv /etc/ssh/sshd_config
UsePrivilegeSeparation yes

If the “UsePrivilegeSeparation” keyword is set to "no", is missing, or the retuned line is commented out, this is a finding.
