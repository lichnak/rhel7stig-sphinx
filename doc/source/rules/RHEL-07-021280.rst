RHEL-07-021280 - The operating system must implement NIST FIPS-validated cryptography for the following: to provision digital signatures, to generate cryptographic hashes, and to protect unclassified information requiring confidentiality and cryptographic protection in accordance with applicable federal laws, Executive Orders, directives, policies, regulations, and standards.

Severity
~~~~~~~~

High

Description
~~~~~~~~~~~

Use of weak or untested encryption algorithms undermines the purposes of using encryption to protect data. The operating system must implement cryptographic modules adhering to the higher standards approved by the federal government since this provides assurance they have been tested and validated.

Satisfies: SRG-OS-000033-GPOS-00014, SRG-OS-000396-GPOS-00176, SRG-OS-000478-GPOS-00223

Check
~~~~~

Verify the operating system implements DoD-approved encryption to protect the confidentiality of remote access sessions.

Check to see if the dracut-fips package is installed with the following command:

# yum list installed | grep dracut-fips

dracut-fips-033-360.el7_2.x86_64.rpm

If the dracut-fips package is installed, check to see if the kernel command line is configured to use FIPS mode with the following command:

Note: GRUB 2 reads its configuration from the “/boot/grub2/grub.cfg” file on traditional BIOS-based machines and from the “/boot/efi/EFI/redhat/grub.cfg” file on UEFI machines.

#grep fips /boot/grub2/grub.cfg
/vmlinuz-3.8.0-0.40.el7.x86_64 root=/dev/mapper/rhel-root ro rd.md=0 rd.dm=0 rd.lvm.lv=rhel/swap crashkernel=auto rd.luks=0 vconsole.keymap=us rd.lvm.lv=rhel/root rhgb fips=1 quiet

If the kernel command line is configured to use FIPS mode, check to see if the system is in FIPS mode with the following command:

# cat /proc/sys/crypto/fips_enabled 1

If the dracut-fips package is not installed, the kernel command line does not have a fips entry, or the system has a value of “0” for fips_enabled in /proc/sys/crypto, this is a finding.
