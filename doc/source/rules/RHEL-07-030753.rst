RHEL-07-030753 - All uses of the unlink command must be audited.
----------------------------------------------------------------

Severity
~~~~~~~~

Medium

Description
~~~~~~~~~~~

If the system is not configured to audit certain activities and write them to an audit log, it is more difficult to detect and track system compromises and damages incurred during a system compromise.

Satisfies: SRG-OS-000466-GPOS-00210, SRG-OS-000467-GPOS-00210, SRG-OS-000468-GPOS-00212, SRG-OS-000392-GPOS-00172

Check
~~~~~

Verify the operating system generates audit records when successful/unsuccessful attempts to use the unlink command occur.

Check the file system rules in /etc/audit/rules.d/audit.rules with the following commands:

Note: The output lines of the command are duplicated to cover both 32-bit and 64-bit architectures. Only the lines appropriate for the system architecture must be present.

# grep -i unlink/etc/audit/rules.d/audit.rules
-a always,exit -F arch=b32 -S unlink -F perm=x -F auid>=1000 -F auid!=4294967295 -F subj=unconfined_u:unconfined_r:unconfined_t:s0-s0:c0.c1023 -k delete
-a always,exit -F arch=b64 -S unlink  -F perm=x -F auid>=1000 -F auid!=4294967295 -F subj=unconfined_u:unconfined_r:unconfined_t:s0-s0:c0.c1023 -k delete

If the command does not return any output, this is a finding.
