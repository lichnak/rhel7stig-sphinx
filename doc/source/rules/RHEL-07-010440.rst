RHEL-07-010440 - The operating system must not allow empty passwords for SSH logon to the system.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Severity
~~~~~~~~

High

Description
~~~~~~~~~~~

Failure to restrict system access to authenticated users negatively impacts operating system security.

Check
~~~~~

Verify the operating system does not allow empty passwords to be used for SSH logon to the system.

Check for the value of the PermitEmptyPasswords keyword with the following command:

# grep -i permitemptypassword /etc/ssh/sshd_config
PermitEmptyPasswords no

If the “PermitEmptyPasswords” keyword is not set to “no”, is missing, or is commented out, this is a finding.
