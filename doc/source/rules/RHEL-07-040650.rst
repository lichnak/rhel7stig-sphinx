RHEL-07-040650 - The SSH private host key files must have mode 0600 or less permissive.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Severity
~~~~~~~~

Medium

Description
~~~~~~~~~~~

If an unauthorized user obtains the private SSH host key file, the host could be impersonated.

Check
~~~~~

Verify the SSH private host key files have mode “0600” or less permissive.

The following command will find all SSH private key files on the system:

# find / -name '*ssh_host*key'

Check the mode of the private host key files under /etc/ssh file with the following command:

# ls -lL /etc/ssh/*key
-rw-------  1 root  wheel  668 Nov 28 06:43 ssh_host_dsa_key
-rw-------  1 root  wheel  582 Nov 28 06:43 ssh_host_key
-rw-------  1 root  wheel  887 Nov 28 06:43 ssh_host_rsa_key

If any file has a mode more permissive than “0600”, this is a finding.
