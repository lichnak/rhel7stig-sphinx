RHEL-07-040333 - The SSH daemon must not allow authentication using RSA rhosts authentication.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Severity
~~~~~~~~

Medium

Description
~~~~~~~~~~~

Configuring this setting for the SSH daemon provides additional assurance that remote logon via SSH will require a password, even in the event of misconfiguration elsewhere.

Check
~~~~~

Verify the SSH daemon does not allow authentication using RSA rhosts authentication.

To determine how the SSH daemon's "RhostsRSAAuthentication" option is set, run the following command:

# grep -i IgnoreUserKnownHosts /etc/ssh/sshd_config

RhostsRSAAuthentication yes

If the value is returned as “no”, the returned line is commented out, or no output is returned, this is a finding.
