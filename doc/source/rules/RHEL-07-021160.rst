RHEL-07-021160 - Cron logging must be implemented.
--------------------------------------------------

Severity
~~~~~~~~

Medium

Description
~~~~~~~~~~~

Cron logging can be used to trace the successful or unsuccessful execution of cron jobs. It can also be used to spot intrusions into the use of the cron facility by unauthorized and malicious users.

Check
~~~~~

Verify that rsyslog is configured to log cron events.

Check the configuration of /etc/rsyslog.conf for the cron facility with the following command:

Note: If another logging package is used, substitute the utility configuration file for /etc/rsyslog.conf. 

# grep cron /etc/rsyslog.conf
cron.* /var/log/cron.log

If the command does not return a response, check for cron logging all facilities by inspecting the /etc/rsyslog.conf file:

# more /etc/rsyslog.conf

Look for the following entry:

*.* /var/log/messages

If rsyslog is not logging messages for the cron facility or all facilities, this is a finding.  

If the entry is in the “/etc/rsyslog.conf” file but is after the entry: *.*', this is a finding.
