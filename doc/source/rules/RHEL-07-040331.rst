RHEL-07-040331 - There must be no shosts.equiv files on the system.
-------------------------------------------------------------------

Severity
~~~~~~~~

High

Description
~~~~~~~~~~~

The shosts.equiv files are used to configure host-based authentication for the system via SSH. Host-based authentication is not sufficient for preventing unauthorized access to the system, as it does not require interactive identification and authentication of a connection request, or for the use of two-factor authentication.

Check
~~~~~

Verify there are no shosts.equiv files on the system.

Check the system for the existence of these files with the following command:

# find / -name shosts.equiv

If any shosts.equiv files are found on the system, this is a finding.
