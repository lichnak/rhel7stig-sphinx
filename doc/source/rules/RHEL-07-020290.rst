RHEL-07-020290 - The system must not have unnecessary accounts.
---------------------------------------------------------------

Severity
~~~~~~~~

Medium

Description
~~~~~~~~~~~

Accounts providing no operational purpose provide additional opportunities for system compromise. Unnecessary accounts include user accounts for individuals not requiring access to the system and application accounts for applications not installed on the system.

Check
~~~~~

Verify all accounts on the system are assigned to an active system, application, or user account.

Obtain the list of authorized system accounts from the Information System Security Officer (ISSO).

Check the system accounts on the system with the following command:

# more /etc/passwd
root:x:0:0:root:/root:/bin/bash
bin:x:1:1:bin:/bin:/sbin/nologin
daemon:x:2:2:daemon:/sbin:/sbin/nologin
sync:x:5:0:sync:/sbin:/bin/sync
shutdown:x:6:0:shutdown:/sbin:/sbin/shutdown
halt:x:7:0:halt:/sbin:/sbin/halt
games:x:12:100:games:/usr/games:/sbin/nologin
gopher:x:13:30:gopher:/var/gopher:/sbin/nologin

Accounts such as “games” and “gopher” are not authorized accounts as they do not support authorized system functions. 

If the accounts on the system do not match the provided documentation, or accounts that do not support an authorized system function are present, this is a finding.
