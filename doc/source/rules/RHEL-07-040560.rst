RHEL-07-040560 - An X Windows display manager must not be installed unless approved.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Severity
~~~~~~~~

Medium

Description
~~~~~~~~~~~

Internet services that are not required for system or application processes must not be active to decrease the attack surface of the system. X Windows has a long history of security vulnerabilities and will not be used unless approved and documented.

Check
~~~~~

Verify that if the system has X Windows installed, it is authorized.

Check for the X11 package with the following command:

#yum groupinstall "X Window System"

Ask the System Administrator (SA) if use of the X Windows system is an operational requirement.

If the use of X Windows on the system is not documented with the Information System Security Manager (ISSM), this is a finding.
