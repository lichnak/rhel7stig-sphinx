RHEL-07-010270 - The SSH daemon must not allow authentication using an empty password.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Severity
~~~~~~~~

High

Description
~~~~~~~~~~~

Configuring this setting for the SSH daemon provides additional assurance that remote logon via SSH will require a password, even in the event of misconfiguration elsewhere.

Check
~~~~~

To determine how the SSH daemon's "PermitEmptyPasswords" option is set, run the following command:

# grep -i PermitEmptyPasswords /etc/ssh/sshd_config

If no line, a commented line, or a line indicating the value "no" is returned, the required value is set.

If the required value is not set, this is a finding.
