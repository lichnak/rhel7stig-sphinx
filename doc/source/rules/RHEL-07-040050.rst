RHEL-07-040050 - The operating system must map the authenticated identity to the user or group account for PKI-based authentication.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Severity
~~~~~~~~

Medium

Description
~~~~~~~~~~~

Without mapping the certificate used to authenticate to the user account, the ability to determine the identity of the individual user or group will not be available for forensic analysis.

Check
~~~~~

Verify the operating system maps the authenticated identity to the user or group account for PKI–based authentication by verifying the common name map file exists with the following command:

# ls –al /etc/pam_pkcs11/cn_map
–rw–r––––– 1 root root 1294 Apr 22 17:22 /etc/pam_pkcs11/subject_mapping

If the file does not exist, this is a finding.
