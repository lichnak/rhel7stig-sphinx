RHEL-07-020640 - All local interactive user home directories defined in the /etc/passwd file must exist.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Severity
~~~~~~~~

Medium

Description
~~~~~~~~~~~

If a local interactive user has a home directory defined that does not exist, the user may be given access to the / directory as the current working directory upon logon. This could create a Denial of Service because the user would not be able to access their logon configuration files, and it may give them visibility to system files they normally would not be able to access.

Check
~~~~~

Verify the assigned home directory of all local interactive users on the system exists.

Check the home directory assignment for all local interactive non-privileged users on the system with the following command:

# cut -d: -f 1,3 /etc/passwd | egrep ":[1-9][0-9]{2}$|:[0-9]{1,2}$"
smithj /home/smithj

Note: This may miss interactive users that have been assigned a privileged UID. Evidence of interactive use may be obtained from a number of log files containing system logon information.

Check that all referenced home directories exist with the following command:

# pwck -r
user 'smithj': directory '/home/smithj' does not exist

If any home directories referenced in “/etc/passwd” are returned as not defined, this is a finding.
