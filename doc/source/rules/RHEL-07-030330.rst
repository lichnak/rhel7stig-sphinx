RHEL-07-030330 - The operating system must off-load audit records onto a different system or media from the system being audited.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Severity
~~~~~~~~

Medium

Description
~~~~~~~~~~~

Information stored in one location is vulnerable to accidental or incidental deletion or alteration.

Off-loading is a common process in information systems with limited audit storage capacity.

Satisfies: SRG-OS-000342-GPOS-00133, SRG-OS-000479-GPOS-00224

Check
~~~~~

Verify the operating system off-loads audit records onto a different system or media from the system being audited.

To determine the remote server that the records are being sent to, use the following command:

# grep -i remote_server /etc/audisp/audisp-remote.conf
remote_server = 10.0.21.1

If a remote server is not configured, or the line is commented out, this is a finding.
