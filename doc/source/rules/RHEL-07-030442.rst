RHEL-07-030442 - All uses of the setsebool command must be audited.
-------------------------------------------------------------------

Severity
~~~~~~~~

Medium

Description
~~~~~~~~~~~

Without generating audit records that are specific to the security and mission needs of the organization, it would be difficult to establish, correlate, and investigate the events relating to an incident or identify those responsible for one.

Audit records can be generated from various components within the information system (e.g., module or policy filter).

Satisfies: SRG-OS-000392-GPOS-00172, SRG-OS-000463-GPOS-00207, SRG-OS-000465-GPOS-00209

Check
~~~~~

Verify the operating system generates audit records when successful/unsuccessful attempts to use the “setsebool” command occur.

Check the file system rule in /etc/audit/rules.d/audit.rules with the following command:

# grep -i /usr/sbin/setsebool /etc/audit/rules.d/audit.rules

-a always,exit -F path=/usr/sbin/setsebool
-F perm=x -F auid>=1000 -F auid!=4294967295 -F subj=unconfined_u:unconfined_r:unconfined_t:s0-s0:c0.c1023 -k privileged-priv_change

If the command does not return any output, this is a finding.
