RHEL-07-020152 - The operating system must prevent the installation of software, patches, service packs, device drivers, or operating system components of packages without verification of the repository metadata.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Severity
~~~~~~~~

High

Description
~~~~~~~~~~~

Changes to any software components can have significant effects on the overall security of the operating system. This requirement ensures the software has not been tampered with and that it has been provided by a trusted vendor.

Accordingly, patches, service packs, device drivers, or operating system components must be signed with a certificate recognized and approved by the organization.

Verifying the authenticity of the software prior to installation validates the integrity of the patch or upgrade received from a vendor. This ensures the software has not been tampered with and that it has been provided by a trusted vendor. Self-signed certificates are disallowed by this requirement. The operating system should not have to verify the software again. This requirement does not mandate DoD certificates for this purpose; however, the certificate used to verify the software must be from an approved Certificate Authority.

Check
~~~~~

Verify the operating system prevents the installation of patches, service packs, device drivers, or operating system components of local packages without verification of the repository metadata.

Check that yum verifies the package metadata prior to install with the following command:

# grep repo_gpgcheck /etc/yum.conf
repo_gpgcheck=1

If "repo_gpgcheck" is not set to ”1”, or if options are missing or commented out, this is a finding.
