RHEL-07-020310 - The root account must be the only account having unrestricted access to the system.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Severity
~~~~~~~~

High

Description
~~~~~~~~~~~

If an account other than root also has a User Identifier (UID) of “0”, it has root authority, giving that account unrestricted access to the entire operating system. Multiple accounts with a UID of “0” afford an opportunity for potential intruders to guess a password for a privileged account.

Check
~~~~~

Check the system for duplicate UID “0” assignments with the following command:

# awk -F: '$3 == 0 {print $1}' /etc/passwd

If any accounts other than root have a UID of “0”, this is a finding.
