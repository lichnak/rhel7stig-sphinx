RHEL-07-040060 - The cn_map file must have mode 0644 or less permissive.
------------------------------------------------------------------------

Severity
~~~~~~~~

Medium

Description
~~~~~~~~~~~

Without mapping the certificate used to authenticate to the user account, the ability to determine the identity of the individual user or group will not be available for forensic analysis.

Check
~~~~~

Verify the operating system protects the file that maps the authenticated identity to the user or group account for PKI–based authentication.

Check the mode on the cn_map file with the following command:

# ls –al /etc/pam_pkcs11/cn_map
–rw––––––– 1 root root 1294 Apr 22 17:22 /etc/pam_pkcs11/cn_map

If the cn_map file has a mode more permissive than “0644”, this is a finding.
