RHEL-07-020620 - All local interactive users must have a home directory assigned in the /etc/passwd file.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Severity
~~~~~~~~

Medium

Description
~~~~~~~~~~~

If local interactive users are not assigned a valid home directory, there is no place for the storage and control of files they should own.

Check
~~~~~

Verify local interactive users on the system have a home directory assigned.

Check for missing local interactive user home directories with the following command:

# pwck -r
user 'lp': directory '/var/spool/lpd' does not exist
user 'news': directory '/var/spool/news' does not exist
user 'uucp': directory '/var/spool/uucp' does not exist
user 'smithj': directory '/home/smithj' does not exist

Ask the System Administrator (SA) if any users found without home directories are local interactive users. If the SA is unable to provide a response, check for users with a User Identifier (UID) of 1000 or greater with the following command:

# cut -d: -f 1,3 /etc/passwd | egrep ":[1-4][0-9]{2}$|:[0-9]{1,2}$"

If any interactive users do not have a home directory assigned, this is a finding.
