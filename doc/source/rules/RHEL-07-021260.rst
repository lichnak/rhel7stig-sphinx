RHEL-07-021260 - The system must use /var/log/audit for the system audit data path.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Severity
~~~~~~~~

Low

Description
~~~~~~~~~~~

The use of separate file systems for different paths can protect the system from failures resulting from a file system becoming full or failing.

Check
~~~~~

Verify that a separate file system/partition has been created for the system audit data path.

Check that a file system/partition has been created for the system audit data path with the following command:

#grep /var/log/audit /etc/fstab
UUID=3645951a    /var/log/audit          ext4    defaults                 1 2

If a separate entry for /var/log/audit does not exist, ask the System Administrator (SA) if the system audit logs are being written to a different file system/partition on the system, then grep for that file system/partition. 

If a separate file system/partition does not exist for the system audit data path, this is a finding.
