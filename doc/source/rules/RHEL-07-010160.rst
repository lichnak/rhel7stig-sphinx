Medium

Description
~~~~~~~~~~~

Use of a complex password helps to increase the time and resources required to compromise the password. Password complexity, or strength, is a measure of the effectiveness of a password in resisting attempts at guessing and brute-force attacks.

Password complexity is one factor of several that determines how long it takes to crack a password. The more complex the password, the greater the number of possible combinations that need to be tested before the password is compromised.

Check
~~~~~

The "maxclassrepeat" option sets the maximum number of allowed same consecutive characters in the same class in the new password.

Check for the value of the maxclassrepeat option in /etc/security/pwquality.conf with the following command:

# grep maxclassrepeat /etc/security/pwquality.conf 
maxclassrepeat = 4

If the value of “maxclassrepeat” is set to more than 4, this is a finding.
