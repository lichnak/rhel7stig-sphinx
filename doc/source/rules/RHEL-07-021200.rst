RHEL-07-021200 - If the cron.allow file exists it must be group-owned by root.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Severity
~~~~~~~~

Medium

Description
~~~~~~~~~~~

If the group owner of the “cron.allow” file is not set to root, sensitive information could be viewed or edited by unauthorized users.

Check
~~~~~

Verify that the “cron.allow” file is group-owned by root.

Check the group owner of the “cron.allow” file with the following command:

# ls -al /etc/cron.allow
-rw------- 1 root root 6 Mar  5  2011 /etc/cron.allow

If the “cron.allow” file exists and has a group owner other than root, this is a finding.
