RHEL-07-020630 - All local interactive user accounts, upon creation, must be assigned a home directory.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Severity
~~~~~~~~

Medium

Description
~~~~~~~~~~~

If local interactive users are not assigned a valid home directory, there is no place for the storage and control of files they should own.

Check
~~~~~

Verify all local interactive users on the system are assigned a home directory upon creation.

Check to see if the system is configured to create home directories for local interactive users with the following command:

# grep -i create_home /etc/login.defs
CREATE_HOME yes

If the value for “CREATE_HOME” parameter is not set to "yes", the line is missing, or the line is commented out, this is a finding.
