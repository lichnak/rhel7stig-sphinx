RHEL-07-040660 - The SSH daemon must not permit Generic Security Service Application Program Interface (GSSAPI) authentication unless needed.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Severity
~~~~~~~~

Medium

Description
~~~~~~~~~~~

GSSAPI authentication is used to provide additional authentication mechanisms to applications. Allowing GSSAPI authentication through SSH exposes the system’s GSSAPI to remote hosts, increasing the attack surface of the system. GSSAPI authentication must be disabled unless needed.

Check
~~~~~

Verify the SSH daemon does not permit GSSAPI authentication unless approved.

Check that the SSH daemon does not permit GSSAPI authentication with the following command:

# grep -i gssapiauth /etc/ssh/sshd_config
GSSAPIAuthentication no

If the “GSSAPIAuthentication” keyword is missing, is set to “yes” and is not documented with the Information System Security Officer (ISSO), or the returned line is commented out, this is a finding.
