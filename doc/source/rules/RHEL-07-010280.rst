RHEL-07-010280 - The operating system must disable account identifiers (individuals, groups, roles, and devices) if the password expires.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Severity
~~~~~~~~

Medium

Description
~~~~~~~~~~~

Inactive identifiers pose a risk to systems and applications because attackers may exploit an inactive identifier and potentially obtain undetected access to the system. Owners of inactive accounts will not notice if unauthorized access to their user account has been obtained.

Operating systems need to track periods of inactivity and disable application identifiers after zero days of inactivity.

Check
~~~~~

Verify the operating system disables account identifiers (individuals, groups, roles, and devices) after the password expires with the following command:

# grep -i inactive /etc/default/useradd
INACTIVE=0

If the value is not set to “0”, is commented out, or is not defined, this is a finding.
