Description
~~~~~~~~~~~

Use of a complex password helps to increase the time and resources required to compromise the password. Password complexity, or strength, is a measure of the effectiveness of a password in resisting attempts at guessing and brute-force attacks.

Password complexity is one factor of several that determines how long it takes to crack a password. The more complex the password, the greater the number of possible combinations that need to be tested before the password is compromised.

Check
~~~~~

Note: The value to require a number of lower-case characters to be set is expressed as a negative number in /etc/security/pwquality.conf.

Check the value for "lcredit" in /etc/security/pwquality.conf with the following command:

# grep lcredit /etc/security/pwquality.conf 
lcredit = -1 

If the value of "lcredit" is not set to a negative value, this is a finding.
