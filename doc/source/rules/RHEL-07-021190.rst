Severity

Medium

Description
~~~~~~~~~~~

If the owner of the "cron.allow" file is not set to root, the possibility exists for an unauthorized user to view or to edit sensitive information.

Check
~~~~~

Verify that the "cron.allow" file is owned by root.

Check the owner of the "cron.allow" file with the following command:

# l s -al /etc/cron.allow
-rw------- 1 root root 6 Mar  5  2011 /etc/cron.allow

If the “cron.allow” file exists and has an owner other than root, this is a finding.
