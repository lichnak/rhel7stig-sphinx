RHEL-07-010020 - The cryptographic hash of system files and commands must match vendor values.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Severity
~~~~~~~~

High

Description
~~~~~~~~~~~

Without cryptographic integrity protections, system command and files can be altered by unauthorized users without detection.

Cryptographic mechanisms used for protecting the integrity of information include, for example, signed hash functions using asymmetric cryptography enabling distribution of the public key to verify the hash information while maintaining the confidentiality of the secret key used to generate the hash.

Check
~~~~~

Verify the cryptographic hash of system files and commands match the vendor values.

Check the cryptographic hash of system files and commands with the following command:

Note: System configuration files (indicated by a "c" in the second column) are expected to change over time. Unusual modifications should be investigated through the system audit log.

# rpm -Va | grep '^..5'

If there is any output from the command for system binaries, this is a finding.
