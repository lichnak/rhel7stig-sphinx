RHEL-07-020160 - USB mass storage must be disabled.
---------------------------------------------------

Severity
~~~~~~~~

Medium

Description
~~~~~~~~~~~

USB mass storage permits easy introduction of unknown devices, thereby facilitating malicious activity.

Satisfies: SRG-OS-000114-GPOS-00059, SRG-OS-000378-GPOS-00163, SRG-OS-000480-GPOS-00227

Check
~~~~~

If there is an HBSS with a Device Control Module and a Data Loss Prevention mechanism, this requirement is not applicable.

Verify the operating system disables the ability to use USB mass storage devices.

Check to see if USB mass storage is disabled with the following command:

#grep -i usb-storage /etc/modprobe.d/*

install usb-storage /bin/true

If the command does not return any output, and use of USB storage devices is not documented with the Information System Security Officer (ISSO) as an operational requirement, this is a finding.
