RHEL-07-020670 - All local interactive user home directories must be group-owned by the home directory owners primary group.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Severity
~~~~~~~~

Medium

Description
~~~~~~~~~~~

If the Group Identifier (GID) of a local interactive user’s home directory is not the same as the primary GID of the user, this would allow unauthorized access to the user’s files, and users that share the same group may not be able to access files that they legitimately should.

Check
~~~~~

Verify the assigned home directory of all local interactive users is group-owned by that user’s primary GID.

Check the home directory assignment for all non-privileged users on the system with the following command:

# cut -d: -f 1,3,4 /etc/passwd | egrep ":[1-4][0-9]{2}$|:[0-9]{1,2}$"
smithj /home/smithj 250

# grep 250 /etc/group
users:x:250:smithj,jonesj,jacksons

Note: This may miss local interactive users that have been assigned a privileged UID. Evidence of interactive use may be obtained from a number of log files containing system logon information.

Check the group owner of all local interactive users’ home directories with the following command:

# ls -al <users home directory>
drwxr-x---  1 smithj users        860 Nov 28 06:43 smithj

If the user home directory referenced in “/etc/passwd” is not group-owned by that user’s primary GID, this is a finding.
