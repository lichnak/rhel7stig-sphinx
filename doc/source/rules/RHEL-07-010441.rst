RHEL-07-010441 - The operating system must not allow users to override SSH environment variables.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Severity
~~~~~~~~

Medium

Description
~~~~~~~~~~~

Failure to restrict system access to authenticated users negatively impacts operating system security.

Check
~~~~~

Verify the operating system does not allow users to override environment variables to the SSH daemon.

Check for the value of the PermitUserEnvironment keyword with the following command:

# grep -i permituserenvironment /etc/ssh/sshd_config
PermitUserEnvironment no

If the “PermitUserEnvironment” keyword is not set to “no”, is missing, or is commented out, this is a finding.
