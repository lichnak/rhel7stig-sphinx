RHEL-07-020700 - All files and directories contained in local interactive user home directories must have mode 0750 or less permissive.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Severity
~~~~~~~~

Medium

Description
~~~~~~~~~~~

If a local interactive user files have excessive permissions, unintended users may be able to access or modify them.

Check
~~~~~

Verify all files and directories contained in a local interactive user home directory, excluding local initialization files, have a mode of “0750”.

Check the mode of all non-initialization files in a local interactive user home directory with the following command:

Files that begin with a “.” are excluded from this requirement.

Note: The example will be for the user “smithj”, who has a home directory of “/home/smithj/home/smithj”

# ls -lLR /<home directory>/<users home directory>/
-rwxr-x--- 1 smithj smithj  18 Mar  5 17:06 file1
-rwxr----- 1 smithj smithj 193 Mar  5 17:06 file2
-rw-r-x--- 1 smithj sa        231 Mar  5 17:06 file3

If any files are found with a mode more permissive than “0750”, this is a finding.
