RHEL-07-040480 - The system must be configured to prevent unrestricted mail relaying.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Severity
~~~~~~~~

Medium

Description
~~~~~~~~~~~

If unrestricted mail relaying is permitted, unauthorized senders could use this host as a mail relay for the purpose of sending spam or other unauthorized activity.

Check
~~~~~

Verify the system is configured to prevent unrestricted mail relaying.

Determine if "postfix" or "sendmail" are installed with the following commands:

# yum list installed | grep postfix
postfix-2.6.6-6.el7.x86_64.rpm 
# yum list installed | grep sendmail

If neither are installed, this is Not Applicable.

If postfix is installed, determine if it is configured to reject connections from unknown or untrusted networks with the following command:

# grep smtpd_client_restrictions /etc/postfix/main.cf
smtpd_client_restrictions = permit_mynetworks, reject

If the “smtpd_client_restrictions” parameter contains any entries other than "permit_mynetworks" and "reject", this is a finding.
