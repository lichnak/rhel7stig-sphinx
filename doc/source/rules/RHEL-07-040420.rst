RHEL-07-040420 - The system must not allow interfaces to perform Internet Protocol version 4 (IPv4) Internet Control Message Protocol (ICMP) redirects by default.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Severity
~~~~~~~~

Medium

Description
~~~~~~~~~~~

ICMP redirect messages are used by routers to inform hosts that a more direct route exists for a particular destination. These messages contain information from the system's route table, possibly revealing portions of the network topology.

Check
~~~~~

Verify the system does not allow interfaces to perform IPv4 ICMP redirects by default.

Check the value of the "default send_redirects" variables with the following command:

# /sbin/sysctl -a | grep  'net.ipv4.conf.default.send_redirects'
net.ipv4.conf.default.send_redirects=0

If the returned line does not have a value of “0”, a line is not returned, or the retuned line is commented out, this is a finding.
