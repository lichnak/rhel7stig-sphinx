RHEL-07-021250 - The system must use a separate file system for /var.
---------------------------------------------------------------------

Severity
~~~~~~~~

Low

Description
~~~~~~~~~~~

The use of separate file systems for different paths can protect the system from failures resulting from a file system becoming full or failing.

Check
~~~~~

Verify that a separate file system/partition has been created for /var.

Check that a file system/partition has been created for /var with the following command:

# grep /var /etc/fstab
UUID=c274f65f    /var                    ext4    noatime,nobarrier        1 2

If a separate entry for /var is not in use, this is a finding.
