RHEL-07-030523 - The operating system must generate audit records containing the full-text recording of modifications to sudo configuration files.

Severity

Medium

Description
~~~~~~~~~~~

Reconstruction of harmful events or forensic analysis is not possible if audit records do not contain enough information.

At a minimum, the organization must audit the full-text recording of privileged access commands. The organization must maintain audit trails in sufficient detail to reconstruct events to determine the cause and impact of compromise.

Satisfies: SRG-OS-000037-GPOS-00015, SRG-OS-000042-GPOS-00020, SRG-OS-000392-GPOS-00172, SRG-OS-000462-GPOS-00206, SRG-OS-000471-GPOS-00215

Check
~~~~~

Verify the operating system generates audit records containing the full-text recording of modifications to sudo configuration files. 

Check for modification of the following files being audited by performing the following commands to check the file system rules in /etc/audit/rules.d/audit.rules: 

# grep -i /etc/sudoers /etc/audit/rules.d/audit.rules

-w /etc/sudoers -p wa -k privileged-actions

# grep -i /etc/sudoers.d/etc/audit/rules.d/audit.rules

-w /etc/sudoers.d/ -p wa -k privileged-actions

If the command does not return output that does not match the examples, this is a finding.
