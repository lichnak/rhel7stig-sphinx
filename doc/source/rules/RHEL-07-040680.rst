RHEL-07-040680 - The SSH daemon must perform strict mode checking of home directory configuration files.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Severity
~~~~~~~~

Medium

Description
~~~~~~~~~~~

If other users have access to modify user-specific SSH configuration files, they may be able to log on to the system as another user.

Check
~~~~~

Verify the SSH daemon performs strict mode checking of home directory configuration files.

The location of the sshd_config file may vary on the system and can be found using the following command:

# find / -name 'sshd*_config' 

If there is more than one ssh server daemon configuration file on the system, determine which daemons are active on the system with the following command:

# ps -ef | grep sshd

The command will return the full path of the ssh daemon. This will indicate which sshd_config file will be checked with the following command:

# grep -i strictmodes /etc/ssh/sshd_config
StrictModes yes

If “StrictModes” is set to "no", is missing, or the retuned line is commented out, this is a finding.
