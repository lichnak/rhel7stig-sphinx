RHEL-07-030382 - All uses of the lchown command must be audited.
----------------------------------------------------------------

Severity
~~~~~~~~

Medium

Description
~~~~~~~~~~~

Without generating audit records that are specific to the security and mission needs of the organization, it would be difficult to establish, correlate, and investigate the events relating to an incident or identify those responsible for one.

Audit records can be generated from various components within the information system (e.g., module or policy filter).

Satisfies: SRG-OS-000064-GPOS-00033, SRG-OS-000392-GPOS-00172, SRG-OS-000458-GPOS-00203, SRG-OS-000474-GPOS-00219

Check
~~~~~

Verify the operating system generates audit records when successful/unsuccessful attempts to use the “lchown” command occur.

Check the file system rules in /etc/audit/rules.d/audit.rules with the following commands:

Note: The output lines of the command are duplicated to cover both 32-bit and 64-bit architectures. Only the lines appropriate for the system architecture must be present.

# grep -i lchown /etc/audit/rules.d/audit.rules

-a always,exit -F arch=b32 -S lchown -F auid>=1000 -F auid!=4294967295 -F subj=unconfined_u:unconfined_r:unconfined_t:s0-s0:c0.c1023 key=perm_mod

-a always,exit -F arch=b64 -S lchown -F auid>=1000 -F auid!=4294967295 -F subj=unconfined_u:unconfined_r:unconfined_t:s0-s0:c0.c1023 key=perm_mod

If the command does not return any output, this is a finding.
