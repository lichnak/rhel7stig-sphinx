RHEL-07-020650 - All local interactive user home directories must have mode 0750 or less permissive.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Severity
~~~~~~~~

Medium

Description
~~~~~~~~~~~

Excessive permissions on local interactive user home directories may allow unauthorized access to user files by other users.

Check
~~~~~

Verify the assigned home directory of all local interactive users has a mode of “0750” or less permissive.

Check the home directory assignment for all non-privileged users on the system with the following command:

# cut -d: -f 1,3 /etc/passwd | egrep ":[1-4][0-9]{2}$|:[0-9]{1,2}$"
smithj /home/smithj

Note: This may miss interactive users that have been assigned a privileged User Identifier (UID). Evidence of interactive use may be obtained from a number of log files containing system logon information.

Check the mode on all local interactive users’ home directories with the following command:

# ls -al <users home directory>
drwxr-x---  1 smithj users        860 Nov 28 06:43 smithj

If home directories referenced in “/etc/passwd” do not have a mode of “0750” or less permissive, this is a finding.
