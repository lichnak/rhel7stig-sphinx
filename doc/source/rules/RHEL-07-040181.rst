RHEL-07-040181 - The operating system must implement cryptography to protect the integrity of Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP) communications.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Severity
~~~~~~~~

Medium

Description
~~~~~~~~~~~

Without cryptographic integrity protections, information can be altered by unauthorized users without detection.

Cryptographic mechanisms used for protecting the integrity of information include, for example, signed hash functions using asymmetric cryptography enabling distribution of the public key to verify the hash information while maintaining the confidentiality of the secret key used to generate the hash.

Check
~~~~~

Verify the operating system implements cryptography to protect the integrity of remote LDAP access sessions.

To determine if LDAP is being used for authentication, use the following command:

# grep -i useldapauth /etc/sysconfig/authconfig
USELDAPAUTH=yes

If USELDAPAUTH=yes, then LDAP is being used. 

Check for the directory containing X.509 certificates for peer authentication with the following command:

# grep -i cacertdir /etc/pam_ldap.conf
tls_cacertdir /etc/openldap/certs

Verify the directory set with the “tls_cacertdir” option exists.

If the directory does not exist or the option is commented out, this is a finding.
