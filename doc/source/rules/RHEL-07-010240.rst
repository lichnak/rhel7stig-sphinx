RHEL-07-010240 - Passwords must be prohibited from reuse for a minimum of five generations.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Severity
~~~~~~~~

Medium

Description
~~~~~~~~~~~

Password complexity, or strength, is a measure of the effectiveness of a password in resisting attempts at guessing and brute-force attacks. If the information system or application allows the user to consecutively reuse their password when that password has exceeded its defined lifetime, the end result is a password that is not changed per policy requirements.

Check
~~~~~

Verify the operating system prohibits password reuse for a minimum of five generations.

Check for the value of the “remember” argument in /etc/pam.d/system-auth with the following command:

# grep -i remember /etc/pam.d/system-auth
password sufficient pam_unix.so use_authtok sha512 shadow remember=5

If the line containing the pam_unix.so line does not have the “remember” module argument set, or the value of the “remember” module argument is set to less than “5”, this is a finding.
