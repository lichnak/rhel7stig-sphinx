RHEL-07-030010 - Auditing must be configured to produce records containing information to establish what type of events occurred, where the events occurred, the source of the events, and the outcome of the events.

These audit records must also identify individual identities of group account users.

Severity

High

Description
~~~~~~~~~~~

Without establishing what type of events occurred, it would be difficult to establish, correlate, and investigate the events leading up to an outage or attack.

Audit record content that may be necessary to satisfy this requirement includes, for example, time stamps, source and destination addresses, user/process identifiers, event descriptions, success/fail indications, filenames involved, and access control or flow control rules invoked.

Associating event types with detected events in the operating system audit logs provides a means of investigating an attack; recognizing resource utilization or capacity thresholds; or identifying an improperly configured operating system.

Satisfies: SRG-OS-000038-GPOS-00016, SRG-OS-000039-GPOS-00017, SRG-OS-000042-GPOS-00021, SRG-OS-000254-GPOS-00095, SRG-OS-000255-GPOS-00096

Check
~~~~~

Verify the operating system produces audit records containing information to establish when (date and time) the events occurred.

Check to see if auditing is active by issuing the following command:

# systemctl is-active auditd.service
Active: active (running) since Tue 2015-01-27 19:41:23 EST; 22h ago

If the auditd status is not active, this is a finding.
