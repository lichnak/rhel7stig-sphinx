RHEL-07-020660 - All local interactive user home directories must be owned by their respective users.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Severity
~~~~~~~~

Medium

Description
~~~~~~~~~~~

If a local interactive user does not own their home directory, unauthorized users could access or modify the user's files, and the users may not be able to access their own files.

Check
~~~~~

Verify the assigned home directory of all local interactive users is owned by that user.

Check the home directory assignment for all non-privileged users on the system with the following command:

# cut -d: -f 1,3 /etc/passwd | egrep ":[1-4][0-9]{2}$|:[0-9]{1,2}$"
smithj /home/smithj

Note: This may miss local interactive users that have been assigned a privileged User Identifier (UID). Evidence of interactive use may be obtained from a number of log files containing system logon information.

Check the owner of all local interactive users home directories with the following command:

# ls -al <users home directory>
drwxr-x---  1 smithj users        860 Nov 28 06:43 smithj

If user home directory referenced in “/etc/passwd” is not owned by that user, this is a finding.
