RHEL-07-040730 - The system must not be performing packet forwarding unless the system is a router.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Severity
~~~~~~~~

Medium

Description
~~~~~~~~~~~

Routing protocol daemons are typically used on routers to exchange network topology information with other routers. If this software is used when not required, system network information may be unnecessarily transmitted across the network.

Check
~~~~~

Verify the system is not performing packet forwarding, unless the system is a router.

Check to see if IP forwarding is enabled using the following command:

# /sbin/sysctl -a | grep  net.ipv4.ip_forward
net.ipv4.ip_forward=0

If IP forwarding value is “1” and the system is hosting any application, database, or web servers, this is a finding.
