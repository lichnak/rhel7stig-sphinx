RHEL-07-010380 - Users must provide a password for privilege escalation.
------------------------------------------------------------------------

Severity
~~~~~~~~

Medium

Description
~~~~~~~~~~~

Without re-authentication, users may access resources or perform tasks for which they do not have authorization. 

When operating systems provide the capability to escalate a functional capability, it is critical the user re-authenticate.

Satisfies: SRG-OS-000373-GPOS-00156, SRG-OS-000373-GPOS-00157, SRG-OS-000373-GPOS-00158

Check
~~~~~

Verify the operating system requires users to supply a password for privilege escalation.

Check the configuration of the /etc/sudoers and /etc/sudoers.d/* files with the following command:

# grep -i nopasswd /etc/sudoers /etc/sudoers.d/*

If any line is found with a "NOPASSWD" tag, this is a finding.
