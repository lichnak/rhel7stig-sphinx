RHEL-07-030561 - All uses of the crontab command must be audited.
-----------------------------------------------------------------

Severity
~~~~~~~~

Medium

Description
~~~~~~~~~~~

Reconstruction of harmful events or forensic analysis is not possible if audit records do not contain enough information.

At a minimum, the organization must audit the full-text recording of privileged commands. The organization must maintain audit trails in sufficient detail to reconstruct events to determine the cause and impact of compromise.

Satisfies: SRG-OS-000042-GPOS-00020, SRG-OS-000392-GPOS-00172, SRG-OS-000471-GPOS-00215

Check
~~~~~

Verify the operating system generates audit records when successful/unsuccessful attempts to use the crontab command occur. 

Check for the following system call being audited by performing the following command to check the file system rules in /etc/audit/rules.d/audit.rules: 

# grep -i /usr/bin/crontab /etc/audit/rules.d/audit.rules

-a always,exit -F path=/usr/bin/crontab -F perm=x -F auid>=1000 -F auid!=4294967295 -F subj=unconfined_u:unconfined_r:unconfined_t:s0-s0:c0.c1023 -k privileged-cron

If the command does not return any output, this is a finding.
