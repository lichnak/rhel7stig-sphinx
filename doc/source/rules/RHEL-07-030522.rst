RHEL-07-030522 - All uses of the sudo command must be audited.
--------------------------------------------------------------

Severity

Medium

Description
~~~~~~~~~~~

Reconstruction of harmful events or forensic analysis is not possible if audit records do not contain enough information.

At a minimum, the organization must audit the full-text recording of privileged access commands. The organization must maintain audit trails in sufficient detail to reconstruct events to determine the cause and impact of compromise.

Satisfies: SRG-OS-000037-GPOS-00015, SRG-OS-000042-GPOS-00020, SRG-OS-000392-GPOS-00172, SRG-OS-000462-GPOS-00206, SRG-OS-000471-GPOS-00215

Check
~~~~~

Verify the operating system generates audit records when successful/unsuccessful attempts to use the “sudo” command occur.

Check for the following system calls being audited by performing the following command to check the file system rules in /etc/audit/rules.d/audit.rules: 

# grep -i /usr/bin/sudo /etc/audit/rules.d/audit.rules

-a always,exit -F path=/usr/bin/sudo -F perm=x -F auid>=1000 -F auid!=4294967295 -k privileged-priv_change

If the command does not return any output, this is a finding.
